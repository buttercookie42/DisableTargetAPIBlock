<p>On Android 14, Google started blocking old apps (those targeting a target API lower than 23, i.e. anything before Marshmallow/Android 6) from being installed.</p><p>While this behaviour can be overridden by calling <code>adb install</code> (respectively <code>pm install</code> if you've got access to a root shell on your device) with the <code>--bypass-low-target-sdk-block</code> flag, it still breaks simple manual installation of older APKs, as well as any backup apps and other software like that which hasn't yet been updated for this new behaviour.</p><p>This Xposed module hooks the app installation process to always behave as if that flag had been passed and to therefore generally allow installation of old apps.</p>
